# `shcripts`

Shell scripts for generic (config) tasks, intended to be linked (or copied) to your `~/.local/bin` (which is intended to be in your path).

The `Makefile` will do the linking automatically based on (rudimentary) detection of available features; i.e. only scripts useful for your current environment will be linked.
